  <h2>Deep Thoughts</h2>
  <h3>by Jack Handy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.</li>
    <li> The crows seemed to be calling his name, thought Caw.</li>
    <li>I hope they never find out that lightning has a lot of vitamins in it, because do you hide from it or not?</li>
    <li>As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red again, I sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a bunch of honking and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way.</li>
    <li>I wish I had a dollar for every time I spent a dollar, because then, yahoo! I'd have all my money back.</li>
  </ul>
